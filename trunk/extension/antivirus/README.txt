#### Setup ####

activate extension

#### Usage ####

1.)
There is a workflow present that can check all uploaded files before publish.

2.)
Any time a webuser downlods a file over content/download it gets checked via the clamd deamon for viruses.

#### Troubleshooting ####

a.) Testing avaialablity of the Daemon

<code>
web1@p15200145:/> telnet localhost 3310
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
SCAN /home/httpd/vhosts/xrow.de/httpdocs/var/storage/original/application/eZWebDAVUpload_yPejc6.zip
/home/httpd/vhosts/xrow.de/httpdocs/var/storage/original/application/eZWebDAVUpload_yPejc6.zip: OK
Connection closed by foreign host.
web1@p15200145:/>
</code>

b.) Resolving permission problems / No Access

By default the daemon run under the user calmav, vscan or else. 
Your permissions might not allow that this user has access to scanned files.
In this case you need to run clamd under the root user or move the clamd user
 into the group of for example apache.

Try to avoid running this service as root.
 
c.) Testing with a test virus

create a text file with the following string
<code>
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
</code>
Upload it into eZ publish and download it. The download should be not avialable now.
